## Analysis
- 2 treatments with the lowest Tumor Volume (mm3) median have relatively similar variation: Capomulin (41.6 and 24.95) and Ramicane (40.7 and 23.5)
- The treatment with the largest Tumor Volume (mm3) median was Ketapril. It also had the largst variation  at 68.6.

### Analysis of Final Tumor Size for Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin

### Capomulin Analysis
In the anaysis of one mouse on this drug regimen, the size of the tumor decreased over time.

When looking at the mice that had this drug regimen, it looks like weight was a factor in the size of the tumor.
27.6% of the variation in Tumor Volume (mm3) can be explained by the mouse's Weight (g).
**The linear regression model found for this drug regimen: Tumor Volume (mm3) = 0.96*[Weight (g)] + 21.49**
